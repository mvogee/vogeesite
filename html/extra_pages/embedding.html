        <p>An interesting note is that its a good idea to set the src of the iframe content with JS
        at the end of the page so that the page loads first and is not slowed down
        by trying to load another website first. Something to keep in mind.</p>
        <p>
          the Embed and Object elements are rarely used anymore as they were mostly
          used for now outdated technologies such as flash content and embedding
          pdfs. Its good to know the tags exist but it is rare that you'll end up using them.
          overall it is rare to used any embedding in your site other than if you need
          to show a map or video or something of those sorts. Also the security
          flaws with iframs make it advisable to not use them whenever possible.
