        This is the page where I am testing images, video, and audio. Its just
        a practice page so not much to see here
      </p>
      <article id="images">
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <img src="../../img/chickenme.jpg" title="me holding a chicken boquet" alt="a lovely photo of myself holding a chicken boquet"
        width="700px" height="auto">
        <figure>
          <img src="../../img/chickenme2.jpg" alt="a lovely photo of myself holding a chicken boquet"
          width="700px" height="auto">
          <figcaption>Me holding a chicken boquet</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Both the above photos are relative path links. That means that they
          refference the image <em>relative</em> to where the page is located in
          the file structure. This means if I were to move this page to a differnt
          folder I would have to updated the src link.
        </p>
        <p>
          These also have some other differences. The first image has a title attribute
          which allows you to hover your mouse over it and get a little message box
          that describes what the image is. the second has a <code>figure</code> tag applied to it
          and a <code>figcaption</code> that allows you to group a caption with the image.
          the <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> can be used on anything though.
          not only images.
        </p>
        <p>Both images have their width set to 700px</p>

          <img src="https://d2rormqr1qwzpz.cloudfront.net/photos/2013/01/02/43548-forbidden_planet.jpg"
          title="public domain image. yes its taken from another site so don't post this bublicly"
          alt="painting of an alein plannet with robot on the surface" width="700px" height="auto">
          <figcaption>forbidden planet</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This image is an absolute link. This means that it is linked from the root folder
          or in this case its absolute web address. In this case if i were to move this page
          into a different folder the link would still work. However it is best to use relative links
          whenever possible becasue they take less time to load.

      <!-- end of the Image section. Beginning of the Video Section -->
      <article id="video">
        <h2>Video</h2>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay controls muted loop preload="none" poster="../../img/chickenme.jpg" width="700px"> <!-- autoplay, controls, muted, loop, and buffer are all optional tags for the video -->
            <source src="../../img/IMG_1125.TRIM.mov" type="video/mp4"> <!-- this tag allows you to include multiple versions of the video source it is highly reccomended-->
            If the browser doesn't support video you can use this space for an alternate text or
            option for the user.
            "Your browser sucks!! Get one that supports video dummy!"

      <article id="audio">
        <h2>Audio</h2>
        <p>
          audio tags are very similar to the video tag the main differences are That
          all the visual elements are gone. you can't set a height or width value
          and there is no poster tag. all the other attribute are available and the same
        </p>

            <p>Your browser sucks and can't handle audio tags. use a better browser.</p>

      <article id="vector-graphics">
        <h2>Vector Graphics</h2>
        <p>There are multiple ways to include vector graphics including using an img tag
        to include the svg file but you can also copy the code directly from the svg hand
        embed it into your html. this is usefull as it allows you to minipulate the svg using
        css and javascript however it makes your html file a lot larger so it is not
        the best idea to use it everywehre. Below is an example.</p>
        <svg width="100%" height="300px">
          <rect width="75%" height="100%" fill="#244673"/>
          <circle cx="45%" cy="45%" r="100" fill="#348899"/>
          <polygon points="400,0 85,100 75,200" fill="#348899"/>
          <text x="50" y="100" font-family="Verdana" font-size="55"
          fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2">
          Hello World!
          </text>
