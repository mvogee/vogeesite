        This is the page where I am testing images, video, and audio. Its just
        a practice page so not much to see here
      </p>
      <article id="images">
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <img src="../../img/chickenme.jpg" title="me holding a chicken boquet" alt="a lovely photo of myself holding a chicken boquet"
        width="700px" height="auto">
        <figure>
          <img src="../../img/chickenme2.jpg" alt="a lovely photo of myself holding a chicken boquet"
          width="700px" height="auto">
          <figcaption>Me holding a chicken boquet</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Both the above photos are relative path links. That means that they
          refference the image <em>relative</em> to where the page is located in
          the file structure. This means if I were to move this page to a differnt
          folder I would have to updated the src link.
        </p>
        <p>
          These also have some other differences. The first image has a title attribute
          which allows you to hover your mouse over it and get a little message box
          that describes what the image is. the second has a <code>figure</code> tag applied to it
          and a <code>figcaption</code> that allows you to group a caption with the image.
          the <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> can be used on anything though.
          not only images.
        </p>
        <p>Both images have their width set to 700px</p>

          title="public domain image. yes its taken from another site so don't post this bublicly"
          alt="painting of an alein plannet with robot on the surface" width="700px" height="auto">

        <p>
          This image is an absolute link. This means that it is linked from the root folder
          or in this case its absolute web address. In this case if i were to move this page
          into a different folder the link would still work. However it is best to use relative links
          whenever possible becasue they take less time to load.

            If the browser doesn't support video you can use this space for an alternate text or
            option for the user.
            "Your browser sucks!! Get one that supports video dummy!"
